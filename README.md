# Cellualr-automata
This repository implements a Cellular Automata model for simulating grain evolution, written in Python and MATLAB. It can read and output .ctf files to process real EBSD data. Some key parts have been removed or modified, but I can provide the full code upon requestâ€”please contact me via email if needed.
